## Machine Learning Fundamentals

Reviewing foundational ML concepts from mathematical perspective following up with practical applications in Python, Covering:

* K Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) and Distance Functions
* Generative Modelling; Probability Spaces and Bivariate Guassians
* Further Generative Modelling; Multivariate Gaussians 
* Regression; Linear/Logistic and Regularisation
* Optimisation: Unconstrained, Convexity, Positive Semidefinite Matrices
* Linear Classification; Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multiclass Linear Prediction
* Further Classifiers; Kernels, Kernel SVM, Decision Trees, Boosting and Random Forests
* Representational Learning; Clustering with; K-Means, Gaussians and Hierarchical Clustering
* Further Representational Learning; Linear Projections, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) , Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors and Spectral Decomposition
* Deep Learning; Autoencoders, Distributed Representation, Feedforward Neural Networks and Training
