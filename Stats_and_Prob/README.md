Reviewing statistical concepts with probability wich are foundational for machine learning, covering:

* Set Thorey
* Combinatronics
* Probability (Axiomatic Formulations)
* Conditional Probaility
* Random variables, Cumulative Dist, Expectation, Varaince and Covariance
*  Discrete Distribution Families
  
     * Bernoulli
     * Binomial
     * Poisson
     * Geometric
 
*  Continuos Distribution Families

     * Uniform
     * Exponential
     * Gaussian
 
*  Inequalities (Markov, Chebyshev, MGF & Law of large numbers) and Limits (Chrnoff Bound and Central Limit Theorem)
*  Parameter Estimation and Confidence Interval
*  Regression (Linear and Polynomial) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
*  Hypothesis Testing (P Values, Z and T tests)
