Reviewing statistical concepts with probability, foundational for machine learning, covering:

* Set Theory
* Combinatronics
* Probability (Axiomatic Formulations)
* Conditional Probability
* Random variables, Cumulative Dist, Expectation, Varaince and Covariance
*  Discrete Distribution Families
     * Bernoulli
     * Binomial
     * Poisson
     * Geometric
 
*  Continuous Distribution Families
     * Uniform
     * Exponential
     * Gaussian
 
*  Inequalities (Markov, Chebyshev, MGF & Law of large numbers) and Limits (Chernoff Bound and Central Limit Theorem)
*  Parameter Estimation and Confidence Interval
*  Regression (Linear and Polynomial) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
*  Hypothesis Testing (P Values, Z and T tests)
